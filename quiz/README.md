# Hello!
#
# Here is my first telegram bot written in Python!
#
# A simple code for creating a quiz. I have divided the code into its component parts to highlight the main aspects that require attention.
# This is creating and working with a database, a list of questions and answers to them, and of course the bot itself. Its buttons, answers, and so on.
