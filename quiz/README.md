# Hello!
#
# Here is my first telegram bot written in Python!
#
# A simple code for creating a quiz. I have divided the code into its component parts to highlight the main aspects that require attention.
# This is creating and working with a database, a list of questions and answers to them, and of course the bot itself. Its buttons, answers, and so on.

# Update 10/05/2025
    # Added Rating System
    # Implemented collection and storage of participantsâ€™ results
    # When re-participating, the previous result of the participant is annulled
    # User Identification System
    # Added mandatory name input before starting the quiz
    # Implemented name uniqueness check
    # The system automatically recognizes existing users by ID and does not re-request the name
    # Results Visualization
    # Added functionality to display the top 5 best participants
